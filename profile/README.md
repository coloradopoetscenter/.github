# Colorado Poets Center

Founded by Robert W. King and Beth Franklin, the [Colorado Poet Center](https://coloradopoetscenter.org) is a 501c3 public non-profit business and a directory of writers who have published poetry and who live and work in Colorado or have strong ties to the state. This site contains Colorado poets' biographical and bibliographical material and selections from published work; videos of poetry webinars; issues of the Colorado Poet, with interviews of selected Colorado poets; and names of high school poets who have won the Robert W. King Poetry Awards. Since Bob’s passing in 2017, his wife, Beth Franklin, has directed the CPC.
